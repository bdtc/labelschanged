# labelschanged

LaTeX **labelschanged** package — Identify labels which cause endless “may have changed” warnings

Several conditions can cause LaTeX labels to keep changing, no matter how many times a document is recompiled.

This package helps diagnose the cause of repeated “Label(s) may have changed” warnings. The names and before/after definitions of changing labels are printed at the end of each compile.

Multiply-defined labels are printed as well.

Based on public-domain code by David Carlisle.
